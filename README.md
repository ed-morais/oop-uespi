# oop-uesp
This GitHub repository contains the exercises and programs developed during the Object-Oriented Programming course at XYZ University. The course covers fundamental concepts of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and teaches students how to apply these concepts to design and implement object-oriented software. The repository includes a variety of programming assignments and projects, ranging from simple programs that illustrate the basics of OOP to more complex projects that demonstrate the application of OOP principles to real-world problems. The repository also includes code samples and resources that will be helpful for students as they work through the course material.
